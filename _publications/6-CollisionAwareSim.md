Soft robots are able to safely interact with environments because of their mechanical compliance. Self-collision is
also employed in the modern design of soft robots to enhance
their performance in different tasks. However, developing an
efficient and reliable simulator which can handle the collision
response well, is still a challenging task in the research of soft
robotics. This paper presents a collision-aware simulator based
on geometric optimization, in which we develop a highly efficient
and realistic collision checking / response model incorporating a
hyperelastic material property. Both actuated deformation and
collision response for soft robots are formulated as geometrybased objectives. The collision-free body of a soft robot can be
obtained by minimizing the geometry-based objective function.
Different from the FEA-based physical simulation, the proposed
pipeline performs a much lower computational cost. Moreover,
adaptive remeshing is applied to achieve the improvement of the
convergence when dealing with soft robots having large volume
variations. Experimental tests are conducted on different soft
robots to verify the performance of our approach.
