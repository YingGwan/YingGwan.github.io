This paper presents a compact system, OpenPneu, to support the pneumatic actuation for multi-chambers on soft robots. 
Micro-pumps are employed in the system to generate airflow and therefore no extra input as compressed air is needed. 
Our system conducts modular design to provide good scalability, which has been demonstrated on a prototype with ten air channels. 
Each air channel of OpenPneu is equipped with both the inflation and the deflation functions to provide
a full range pressure supply from positive to negative with a maximal flow rate at 1.7 L/min. 
High precision closed-loop control of pressures has been built into our system to achieve stable and efficient dynamic 
performance in actuation. An opensource control interface and API in Python are provided. We also demonstrate the functionality of OpenPneu on three soft
robotic systems with up to 10 chambers.
