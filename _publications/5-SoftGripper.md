In this paper, we presented a data-driven framework to optimize the
out-of-plane stiffness for soft grippers to achieve mechanical
properties as hard-to-twist and easy-to-bend. The effectiveness of this
method is demonstrated in the design of a soft pneumatic bending
actuator (SPBA). First, a new objective function is defined to
quantitatively evaluate the out-of-plane stiffness as well as the
bending performance. Then, sensitivity analysis is conducted on the
parametric model of an SPBA design to determine the optimized design
parameters with the help of Finite Element Analysis (FEA). To enable
the computation of numerical optimization, a data-driven approach is
employed to learn a cost function that directly represents the
out-of-plane stiffness as a differentiable function of the design
variables. A gradient-based method is used to maximize the out-of-plane
stiffness of the SPBA while ensuring specific bending performance. The
effectiveness of our method has been demonstrated in physical
experiments taken on 3D-printed grippers.
