Hi, welcome to my personal page!


I am a Ph.D. Candidate from The University of Manchester, mainly supervised by [Prof. Charlie C.L. Wang](https://mewangcl.github.io/). 
Prior to that, I received my B.E. in Mechanical Engineering from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019. 

My research interests include soft robotics, computational design and machine-learning-based shape control.
